# PIC32-Thermostat-ECE-3720

This was a project for ECE 3720 Microcontroller Interfacing at Clemson University. 

Created a thermostat around a PIC32 microcontroller. The user could set the desired temperature with an optical encoder, and a fan would regulate the temperature around a TMP36 sensor. The current and set temperatures were both displayed on an HD44780 driven LCD.
